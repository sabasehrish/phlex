### Summary

The pull request `maintenance/fix-codeql-reports` is not showing any CodeQL alerts as "fixed" because of a fundamental mismatch in how the alerts are categorized between the `main` branch and the pull request. This prevents GitHub's code scanning tools from correlating the fixes in the PR with the existing alerts.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yaml` workflow file. In the `Perform CodeQL Analysis` step, the `category` for the analysis is explicitly set to the language being analyzed:

```yaml
- name: Perform CodeQL Analysis
  uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v4
  with:
    category: ${{ matrix.language }} # This will be 'cpp', 'python', or 'actions'
```

Historically, the CodeQL alerts on the `main` branch were submitted with a default category. By introducing this new, language-specific categorization, the alerts generated by the pull request are treated as entirely separate from the ones on `main`, even if they refer to the same underlying code issue.

### How this Prevents "Fixed" Alerts from Being Detected

The `check_codeql_alerts.py` script, which is responsible for reporting on new and fixed alerts, is unable to bridge this category gap. It attempts to identify fixed alerts in two ways:

1.  **By checking the SARIF file:** The script looks for a `baselineState` of `"absent"` in the SARIF file generated by the CodeQL action. However, because of the category mismatch, the CodeQL action itself cannot determine that an alert has been fixed, so it doesn't set this state.
2.  **By comparing alerts via the GitHub API:** As a fallback, the script fetches the list of alerts from the `main` branch and compares it to the list from the pull request. This comparison also fails because the API treats alerts in different categories as distinct, so the script cannot find any overlap.

### Conclusion

The system is working as designed, but the change in categorization has created a discontinuity in the alert tracking. To resolve this, the historical alerts on `main` will need to be addressed in a way that acknowledges this new categorization scheme. As you've already indicated, manually dismissing the old alerts after merging the PR is a viable path forward. No changes to the workflow or codebase are necessary to "fix" this, as it's a matter of managing the historical baseline.
